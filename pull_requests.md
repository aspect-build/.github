We use a Pull Request template to gather information that's important to reviewers.

For repositories that use a squash merge strategy, the pull request description may also be used as the landed commit description.
In this case, the Pull Request template also ensures useful information ends up in the git log.

## Requirements

A Pull Request description should include a summary of your changes and link to the related issue(s).

Please also include relevant motivation and context for why you made the change, how you arrived at this design, or alternatives considered.

## Instructions

- Delete prompts and options from the template that aren't needed
