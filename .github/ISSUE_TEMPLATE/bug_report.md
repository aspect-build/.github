**We use GitHub issues only for feature requests and bug reports.** For support questions, please use [Bazel slack](https://slack.bazel.build)**.  We prioritize support requests from our paid support customers, see [aspect.dev](https://www.aspect.dev/services#support).


* **What is the current behavior?**



* **Your bug is more likely to be resolved if you provide the steps to reproduce, and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**



* **What is the expected behavior?**



* **Please tell us about your environment:**
  
  - Development (host) and target OS/architectures:
  - `bazel --version`: 
  - Version of the aspect rules, or other relevant rules from your `WORKSPACE` or `MODULE.bazel` file:
  - Language(s) and/or frameworks involved:


* **Any other information?** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, things you've tried, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

* **I'd like my bug fixed right away!** you can help fund our open source work at the same time: donate a [bug bounty](https://opencollective.com/aspect-build/)
